  abstract = {Binaural rendering of Ambisonic signals is of great interest in
              the fields of virtual reality, immersive media, and virtual
              acoustics. Typically, the spatial order of head-related impulse
              responses (HRIRs) is considerably higher than the order of the
              Ambisonic signals. The resulting order reduction of the HRIRs has
              a detrimental effect on the binaurally rendered signals, and
              perceptual evaluations indicate limited externalization,
              localization accuracy, and altered timbre. In this contribution,
              a binaural renderer, which is computed using a
              frequency-dependent time alignment of HRIRs followed by a
              minimization of the squared error subject to a diffuse-field
              covariance matrix constraint, is presented. The
              frequency-dependent time alignment retains the interaural time
              difference (at low frequencies) and results in a HRIR set with
              lower spatial complexity, while the constrained optimization
              controls the diffuse-field behavior. Technical evaluations in
              terms of sound coloration, interaural level differences,
              diffuse-field response, and interaural coherence, as well as
              findings from formal listening experiments show a significant
              improvement of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art
              methods.},
